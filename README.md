Design an API with 3 endpoints:
each endpoint must have their own Controller file, inside the Controller folder
Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder

Endpoints:
1. endpoint that accepts 2 numbers.  Once you have the numbers, add them together and print out the results in a sentence.
     - Example results, "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4."

2. endpoint that accepts 2 inputs. You will take the answer from those inputs and display the answer in one sentence.
     - What is your name? 
     - What time did you wake up?
     *Your output should be a sentence that tells me who the person is and what time they woke up

3. endpoint that accepts 2 numbers. Results should print the following 2 statements:
     I. The first statement should tell me if the first number is greater than, less than or equal to the second number.
     II. The second statement should tell me if the second number is greater than, less than, or equal to the first number.

Peer Review: Aaron Robinson
the endpoints work as intended and the code is organized. Although, I dont think the .ToString() method on the AddTwoNumsService is neccessary and I'd add puncation just so you don't get marked for it. Great Job
